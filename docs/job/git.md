# Job Type: Git
It's not necessary to have all your job definitions in your own project. With the git job type you can include job definitions for any accessible git repository.

An example git job definition:
```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "jobs": [{
        "type": "git",
        "name": "some-external-jobs",
        "clone_url": "https://github.com/SAP/infrabox-examples.git",
        "commit": "master",
        "depends_on": [ ... ],
        "environment": { ... },
        "infrabox_file": "infrabox.json"
    }]
}
```
